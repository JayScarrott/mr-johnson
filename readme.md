## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The band and I all had an initial meeting, where we discussed what we wanted the website to be. We covered layout, colour scheme, fonts, and overall content.
I let the band discuss their ideas and helped guide them towards realistic expectations as this would be my first website.

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* All the information fans of the band would like
* Easy navigation throughout the site
* Quick access to social media of Mr Johnson
* Consistent style throughout the the site, fitting Mr Johnson

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We knew initially that we wanted the page to have a warm feel, yellows and oranges were agreed upon. Then we gravitated towards more 60s/70s styling, so reds and light blues were used to compliment and contrast with the base colours.

Once I actually began styling the website with the initial colour scheme, I tested the accessibility on Google developer tools, with Lighthouse, and found that with the current colour scheme, the text, especially the headings, were very hard to read. I used the Deque University Colour Contrast Analyzer, and it turns out that orange text is rather hard to read.

I've changed the colour scheme to mainly consist of yellows and blues, with black text. This helps with the accessibility of the site, but gives the website quite a striking presentation.

### Typography

![Font Ideas](assets/readme/font-ideas.webp)

Once we knew the overall "vibe" we were going for, we looked at a lot of different fonts. One of the band members sent the above picture with font ideas. I did say that I may not be able to use them exactly, as they are from 1001fonts and dafont, but I'll stick as close as I can, wishing to use Google fonts for my first project, to keep things relatively simple.

### Imagery

Being a website for a band, most of the imagery will be either shots of the band or some more artistic shots that relate to the band.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.

Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

I wrote the majority of the content, but the band members all wrote their own bios for the about page.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
