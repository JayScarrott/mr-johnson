## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

The band and I all had an initial meeting, where we discussed what we wanted the website to be. We covered layout, colour scheme, fonts, and overall content.
I let the band discuss their ideas and helped guide them towards realistic expectations as this would be my first website.

### User Stories

#### Target Audience

The target audience for this website, is fans for the band Mr Johnson, who want to stay update with the band and interact with media related to the band.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* All the information fans of the band would like
* Easy navigation throughout the site
* Be able to hear what the band sounds like
* Have easy access to our social media platforms
* See upcoming Mr Johnson gigs
* Have access to a way to contact Mr Johnson

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We knew initially that we wanted the page to have a warm feel, yellows and oranges were agreed upon. Then we gravitated towards more 60s/70s styling, so reds and light blues were used to compliment and contrast with the base colours.

Once I actually began styling the website with the initial colour scheme, I tested the accessibility on Google developer tools, with Lighthouse, and found that with the current colour scheme, the text, especially the headings, were very hard to read. I used the Deque University Colour Contrast Analyzer, and it turns out that orange text is rather hard to read.

I've changed the colour scheme to mainly consist of yellow and blue, with black text. This helps with the accessibility of the site, but gives the website quite a striking presentation.

### Typography

![Font Ideas](assets/readme/font-ideas.webp)

Once we knew the overall "vibe" we were going for, we looked at a lot of different fonts. One of the band members sent the above picture with font ideas. I did say that I may not be able to use them exactly, as they are from 1001fonts and dafont, but I'll stick as close as I can, wishing to use Google fonts for my first project, to keep things relatively simple.

### Imagery

Being a website for a band, most of the imagery will be either shots of the band or some more artistic shots that relate to the band.

## Features

### General features on each page

* A header that consists of a logo with a hyperlink to the Home page and a responsive navigation bar, with buttons for each page of the site.
* A footer that has links to Youtube, Facebook and an email link that all open in new pages.

### Future Implementations

* Having changed my website to a one-page website, I'd like to make it clear which page is actually active, once you've reached the anchor for that page section.
* I'd like to have a more diverese colour scheme, but my main focus was accessibility with this current iteration.
* Include more content so the website can go back to having multiple seperate HTML as opposed to one.

### Accessibility

I have tried my hardest to make the site as accessible as possible, I have done this by:

* Using semantic HTML where possible
* Having a contrasting colour scheme
* Easy to read text
