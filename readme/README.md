## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

The band and I all had an initial meeting, where we discussed what we wanted the website to be. We covered layout, colour scheme, fonts, and overall content.
I let the band discuss their ideas and helped guide them towards realistic expectations as this wold be my first website.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We knew initially that we wanted the page to have a warm feel, yellows and oranges were agreed upon. Then we gravitated towards more 60s/70s styling, so reds and light blues were used to compliment and contrast with the base colours.

### Typography

![Font Ideas](readme/IMG-20240610-WA0000.png)

Once we knew the overall "vibe" we were going for, we looked at a lot of different fonts. One of the band members sent the above picture with font ideas. I did say that I may not be able to use them exactly, as they are from 1001fonts and dafont, but I'll stick as close as I can, wishing to use Google fonts for my first project, to keep things relatively simple.

### Imagery

Being a website for a band, most of the imagry will be either shots of the band or some more artistic shots that relate to the band.

### Wireframes

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML
CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Balsamiq - Used to create wireframes

Coolers - Used for colour palette selection

Google Fonts - Used for Fonts

Replit - Initially used to write the code before moving to Visual Studio

Visual Studio Code - Used to write code for main project

Notepad - Quick place to store code when changing for comparison

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.

Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
