## Automated Testing

### Lighthouse

The main thing that gave poor results in the Lighthouse test was the best practices. Looking at this, it's third party cookies that are causing the issue.

I also had a problem with the performance when testing it for mobile, it would vary quite regularly. I think  this is mainly down to the age of my laptop, with which I was testing the website.
